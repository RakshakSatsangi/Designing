\section{External Design}
	Ball speeds can be updated even when the balls are moving. 
	
	Instead of taking random positions after changing the speed, the balls will move from same position without any disturbance. 
	
	There is no limit to the speed, although the screen will not be clear at very high speeds.The ball sizes are also randomly generated at the start instead of being fixed. 


\section{GUI}
		We have used orthographic projection to view spherical balls colliding in the same plane. 
		
		Lighting and shining effects have been used to give a realistic feel of the view. 
		
		To facilitate on how to change speeds, a menu screen and an instruction screen has been provided. Ball speed can be increased, decreased or they can be stopped by using left, right and middle mouse clicks respectively. 
		
Gravity forces can be experienced from all 4 sides corresponding to each wall using key pressing.
